## :material-account-multiple-check: Multi-Department Coordination

### Faculty-Level Processing

**Coordinated Academic Management:**

**Engineering Faculty Example:**
```
🏗️ Faculty of Engineering:
├── Mechanical Engineering Department
│   ├── Year 1: 120 students
│   ├── Year 2: 98 students
│   ├── Year 3: 85 students
│   └── Year 4: 76 students
├── Electrical Engineering Department
│   ├── Similar year structure
│   └── Shared core courses
└── Computer Science Department
    ├── Different progression model
    └── Specialized requirements
```

### Cross-Department Dependencies

**Shared Course Management:**

| Course Type | Management | DEEPS Handling |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Core Requirements** | Central coordination | Multi-department access |
| **Shared Courses** | Lead department | Cross-enrollment tracking |

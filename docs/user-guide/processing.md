Learn how to efficiently process examination results from Excel files into DEEPS.

## :material-file-import: Excel Data Import

### Preparing Excel Files

Before importing, ensure Excel files follow these guidelines:

**Required Columns:**
```
Student ID | Student Name | Course Code | Course Name | Marks | Grade
REG001     | John Doe     | CS101       | Programming | 85    | A
REG002     | Jane Smith   | CS101       | Programming | 72    | B
```

**File Format Requirements:**
- Excel files (.xlsx or .xls)
- UTF-8 encoding for special characters
- No merged cells in data areas
- Clear column headers in first row
- No empty rows in data range

### Import Process

**Step 1: Start Import Wizard**
1. Navigate to **Data** → **Import Excel Data**
2. Select the Excel file from your computer
3. Choose the worksheet containing exam data
4. Preview data to ensure correct formatting

**Step 2: Column Mapping**
```
Excel Column          →    DEEPS Field
"Registration No"     →    Student ID
"Student Names"       →    Student Name
"Course Unit Code"    →    Course Code
"Course Unit Name"    →    Course Name
"Total Marks"         →    Marks
"Letter Grade"        →    Grade
```

**Step 3: Data Validation**
- Verify student ID format matches institutional standards
- Check marks are within valid range (0-100)
- Confirm grades align with institutional scale
- Review any flagged inconsistencies

## :material-database-check: Data Validation

### Automatic Validation Checks

DEEPS performs comprehensive validation during import:

=== "Student Validation"
    **Identity Verification:**
    - Student ID format compliance
    - Duplicate student detection
    - Name consistency checking
    - Enrollment status verification

=== "Course Validation"
    **Academic Integrity:**
    - Course code verification
    - Prerequisite requirement checking
    - Credit hour validation
    - Academic year consistency

=== "Grade Validation"
    **Grading Standards:**
    - Marks within valid range (0-100)
    - Grade-to-marks correspondence
    - Grading scheme compliance
    - Statistical outlier detection

### Handling Validation Errors

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

| Error Type | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Invalid Student ID** | ID doesn't match format | Check institutional numbering system |
| **Duplicate Records** | Same student/course pair | Review for data entry errors |
| **Grade Mismatch** | Marks don't align with grade | Verify lecturer's grading scheme |
| **Missing Course** | Course not in system | Add course to database first |
| **Out of Range** | Marks exceed 100 or below 0 | Correct data entry errors |

**Error Resolution Workflow:**
1. Review error report generated by DEEPS
2. Correct issues in original Excel file
3. Re-import corrected data
4. Verify all validations pass

### Understanding Grading Systems

DEEPS supports multiple grading schemes:

=== "Letter Grades"
    ```
    A   = 70-100   (Excellent)
    B   = 60-69    (Good)
    C   = 50-59    (Average)
    D   = 40-49    (Pass)
    E   = 0-39     (Fail)
    ```

=== "GPA Scale"
    ```
    A   = 4.0   B+  = 3.5   B   = 3.0
    C+  = 2.5   C   = 2.0   D+  = 1.5
    D   = 1.0   E   = 0.0
    ```

=== "Percentage"
    ```
    Direct percentage scores
    Pass mark: 40% (configurable)
    ```

### Special Grade Categories

**Supplementary Examinations:**
- **SUPP** - Student must retake examination
- **CARRY** - Course continues to next semester
- **INC** - Incomplete due to medical/emergency

**Administrative Grades:**
- **AUDIT** - Course audited, no credit
- **PASS** - Credit granted without grade
- **TRANSFER** - Credit from another institution

### Academic Standing Calculation

DEEPS automatically calculates student academic standing:

**GPA Calculation:**
```
Semester GPA = Σ(Grade Points × Credit Hours) / Σ(Credit Hours)
Cumulative GPA = Total Grade Points / Total Credit Hours
```

**Academic Status Determination:**
- **Good Standing**: GPA ≥ 2.0
- **Academic Warning**: GPA 1.5-1.99
- **Academic Probation**: GPA 1.0-1.49
- **Academic Suspension**: GPA < 1.0

2. Collect all course files in single folder
3. Use batch import wizard
4. Monitor processing progress
5. Review consolidated error report

**Processing Optimization:**
- Process courses by department/faculty
- Handle prerequisite courses first
- Batch similar grading schemes together
- Schedule processing during low-usage times

### Quality Control Procedures

**Pre-Processing Checklist:**
- [ ] All Excel files use standard template
- [ ] Course codes verified in system
- [ ] Student IDs validated
- [ ] Grading schemes confirmed
- [ ] Backup created before processing

## :material-alert-circle: Troubleshooting

### Common Processing Issues

**Import Failures:**
```
Issue: "Column mapping failed"
Solution: Verify Excel headers match expected format

Issue: "Duplicate student records"
Solution: Check for multiple entries of same student

Issue: "Invalid grade values"
Solution: Ensure grades match institutional scale
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Large files (>5MB) may require extended processing time
- Network drives can slow import process
- Concurrent user access may affect performance

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Failed imports don't modify existing data
- Use database rollback for problematic batches
- Restore from automatic backups if needed
